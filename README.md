# Pirate Bartender
This application is designed to test my knowledge of objects, constructors, and inheritance. Once a user submits their answers to a few simple yes or no questions, they will recieve a cocktail recipe for their enjoyment. 

Main goals :
1) utilize objects, and constructors
2) understand inheritence 
3) have others review this code 
4) allow time to review others code
